# digtech-subject
A "path" offering one way into the Digital Technologies subject from the Australian Curriculum.

The content here is based on learning materials produced for the University of Southern Queensland course [EDM8006, Curriculum and Pedagogical Studies 2: Arts & Technologies](http://www.usq.edu.au/course/specification/2016/EDM8006-S2-2016-WEB-TWMBA.html). 

Initially, this repository is intended to be a test space for the technology being developed as part of the [Moodle open Book module project](https://davidtjones.wordpress.com/research/the-moodle-open-book-module-project/). However, it may form the basis for more exploration around the integration of open educational practice into initial teacher education.
