<p>When you are teaching, the Digital technologies subject is not the only place you will come across digital technologies. There are at 4 different places (including the Digital technologies subject) where you will find digital technologies. These places will be found in most educational contexts, regardless of the curriculum documents being used. </p>
<p>This book is intended to explicitly identify all of the locations where digital technology is mentioned and offer one explanation of the relationship between them.</p>

<h3>Defining ICT as digital technology</h3>

<p>The Australian Curriculum documents and many education-related publications will use the acronym ICT to standard for Information and Communication Technologies. This has been a common term used within education for a number of years to encapsulate digital technologies.</p>
<p>Over recent years the trend is increasingly to use the term digital technologies. In this ramble I will define ICT as digital technology.</p>

<p>Kirschner and Wopereis (2003) suggest three reasons why that &quot;an increasing number of countries include ICT in the curricula of initial teacher training&quot; (p. 105). These &quot;big three&quot; reasons also help explain why the use of ICT is increasingly being included in schools.</p>
<p>The big three reasons for using digital technologies are:</p>
<ol>
  <li> ICT can help prepare the next generation for the future workplace;
       <p>The assumption is that to be a productive member of society from now and into the future, they will have to be effective users of digital technologies (ICT).</p>
        <p>Are you prepared for a teaching workplace that relies heavily on digital technologies?</p>
</li>
  <li> ICT can make schools more efficient and productive; and, 
       <p>Digital technologies are meant to make any number of tasks more efficient and productive. Learning and teaching is no different.</p>
      <p>Are you currently using digital technologies to make your learning more efficient and productive?</p>
  </li>
  <li> ICT can reform and innovate learning and teaching.
      <p>More importantly (for me), digital technologies can enhance and transform learning and teaching. Enable you to design learning experiences that were previously impossible.</p>
      <p>How can you enhance and transform your learning and teaching?</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>The four places you will find digital technologies when you are teaching connect with different reasons from the big three.</p>

<p>The four places you may encounter digital technologies are listed in the table below. They are split into two categories. Curriculum (what is to be taught) specify the places where you will find digital technologies explicitly mentioned in curriculum documents. For this course, we&#39;re using the Australian Curriculum.  Pedagogy (how it is to be taught) is not typically explicitly mentioned in curriculum documents.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the distinction between these two categories is not always clear.</p>

<p>Within the Australian Curriculum documents, you will find digital technologies mentioned in at least three places.</p>

<h3>ICT general capability</h3>

<p>As you may already be aware, the Australian Curriculum contains a range of General Capabilities. <a href="http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/generalcapabilities/overview/introduction"> The general capabilities</a> are designed to ensure that learners develop knowledge, skills, behaviours and dispositions (capability) to &quot;live and work successfully in the 21st century.</p> 
<p>One of these general capabilities is <a href="http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/generalcapabilities/information-and-communication-technology-capability/introduction/introduction">the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) capability</a>. It aims to help students develop the necessary capability to use digital technologies to &quot;live and work successfully in the 21st century&quot;. It aims to help students develop the capability to communicate, create, and investigate with ICT, and while doing so manage and operate the ICT in ways that are safe and ethical.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/generalcapabilities/information-and-communication-technology-capability/continuum#layout=columns">The ICT general capability Learning Continuum</a> defines what capabilities learners should develop as they progress through their schooling.  As you a teacher it is your responsibility that you provide students the opportunity to develop these capabilities by embedding the use of digital technologies into the other learning areas.</p>
<p>As shown below, where appropriate content descriptions from the Australian Curriculum will explicitly identify many of the places where a general capability (ICT or otherwise) can be developed.</p>

<h3>Digital technologies subject</h3>

<p>This is the focus for this week.</p>
<p>The subject is designed to provider learners with the knowledge and skills necessary to actively create and shape solutions with digital technologies.  According to <a href="http://www.acara.edu.au/verve/_resources/Technologies_-_GC_learning_area.pdf">the Australian Curriculum</a> the Digital technologies subject will strengthen, complement and extend the learners' ICT general capability.</p>
<p>Arguably, the ICT general capability focuses on developing the capability for learners to use ICT appropriately within the context of other tasks. The Digital technologies subject aims to depend that capability and move students to being able to understand, modify, and develop solutions to problems using digital technologies. The subject helps students move toward an understanding of computer science.</p>

<h3>Content descriptions in other learning areas</h3>

<p>You can also find digital technologies specifically mentioned in content descriptions. For example, <a href="http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/english/curriculum/f-10?layout=1">the Year 1 English learning area</a> includes the following content description</p>
<blockquote>Recreate texts imaginatively using drawing, writing, performance and digital forms of communication (<a href="http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/curriculum/contentdescription/ACELT1586">ACELT1586</a>)</blockquote>
<p>The content description specifically identifies that it is necessary for students to develop some knowledge and skill using digital technologies.</p>
<p> If you look at <a href="http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/curriculum/contentdescription/ACELT1586">the content description</a> on the Australian Curriculum website, you will see that it is linked to the ICT general capability (look for the small blue icon of an arrow and three dots).</p>
<p>This is an example of how digital technologies are becoming important tools in all sorts of disciplines. Mathematicians, musicians, artists, writers, and many more professional now rely on digital technologies to help them perform as mathematicians, musicians, artists, and writers.</p>

<p>The previous page described the three places you can find digital technologies within the Australian Curriculum. These places represent <em>what the students should learn</em>.  These are examples of how the designers of the curriculum are attempting to respond to Kirschner &amp; Wopereis's (2003) first big reason <em>ICT can help prepare the next generation for the future workplace</em></p>
<p>This page looks at how digital technologies can be used as part of pedagogy i.e. <em>how you teach learners</em>. This links to Kirschner &amp; Wopereis's (2003) last big reason: <em>ICT can reform and innovate learning and teaching</em>.</p>

<p>There is an assumption that the practice of learning and teaching can be enhanced and transformed through the use of digital technologies. This requires teachers to be familiar enough with digital technologies and to have the resources necessary to plan differently using digital technologies. The most common examples in current schools revolve around the use of Interactive Whiteboards, playing of Youtube videos, and the use of sites such as <a href="http://readingeggs.com/">Reading Eggs</a> and <a href="http://readingeggs.com/">IXL Math</a>.</p>
<p>Digital technologies can be used to enhance learning of any learning area.</p>
<p>The focus in this course is on the curriculum and the Digital technologies subject. However, as you develop that knowledge and think about the assignments, remember that you can use digital technologies to enhance and transform how the learners learn.</p>


<div class="dj_task"> 
   <div class="dj_task_title"><p>What examples of digital technologies and pedagogy have you seen?</p></div>  
   <div class="dj_activity">
      <p>At this stage, you will have spent some time in schools, been enrolled in a number of University courses, and completed a number of assignments where you design learning experiences. During those experiences, what examples of digital technologies and pedagogy have you seen? What did you like? What helped you learn? What didn't?</p>
      <p>e.g. the rambles from this week and last embody a particular combination of digital technology and pedagogy.</p>

   <div class="dj_task_title"><p>How many places have you visited?</p></div>  
   <div class="dj_activity">
        <p>In your time as a pre-service teacher, how many of the four places have you visited in courses and on Professional Experience? Either through your own teaching, or through observations of others.</p>
        <p>Are there other teaching related places where you&#39;ve seen digital technology?</p>
