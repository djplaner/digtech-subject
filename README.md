# digtech-subject
A "path" offering one way into the [Digital Technologies subject](http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/technologies/digital-technologies/rationale) from [the Australian Curriculum](http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/technologies/).

The content here is based on learning materials produced for the University of Southern Queensland course [EDM8006, Curriculum and Pedagogical Studies 2: Arts & Technologies](http://www.usq.edu.au/course/specification/2016/EDM8006-S2-2016-WEB-TWMBA.html). 

Initially, this repository is intended to be a test space for the technology being developed as part of the [Moodle open Book module project](https://davidtjones.wordpress.com/research/the-moodle-open-book-module-project/). However, it may form the basis for more exploration around the integration of open educational practice into initial teacher education.

# About the content
The content here is a sequence of "books" (a collection of web pages) that were designed to fit within the Moodle course site for EDM8006. Hence there is mention of Moodle-based resources such as quizzes and readings.

The content here is also from the second of two weeks produced using this approach. The first week introduced the broader Technologies learning area and the Design and technologies subject.
