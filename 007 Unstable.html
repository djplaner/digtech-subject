<h3>The nature of digital technologies</h3>

<p>We now move from the fundamental properties of digital technologies (data homogenisation and reprogrammability) onto the nature of digital technologies as described by Koehler and Mishra (2009) who identified digital technologies as: unstable, opaque, and protean.  We&#39;ll start with unstable in this book. The next two books will focus on opaque and protean.</p>

<h3>Unstable</h3>

<p>Koehler and Mishra (2009) define unstable as &quot;rapidly changing&quot; (p. 61). Unstable is perhaps the feature of digital technology that is most familiar to you (it&#39;s also the one least discussed within the Digital technologies subject). An example of the rapidly changing nature of digital technology is the observation from earlier in this book that most contemporary cars have over 50 microcontrollers, each of which is more powerful than the single guidance computer on the Apollo moon landings. The following images shows an evolution of how the representation of the computer game character Lara Croft has evolved from 1996 through to 2013.</p>

<h3>Rest of this book</h3>

<p>The Digital technologies subject doesn&#39;t include significant recognition of the unstable nature of digital technologies. So this book won&#39;t link to specific resources for teaching the Digital technologies subject. However, it does use an example of the unstable nature of digital technology to connect to an important part of the Digital technologies subject.</p>

<h4>Then</h4>

<p>The following image is of a IBM Model 350 Disk File from 1956. The equivalent of a hard-drive. The device included 50 24-inch discs, weighed 1 ton, and could hold a &quot;massive&quot; 5Mb (you'll see just how small that is soon).</p>
<p>You didn't buy the computer it was attached to, you had to lease the computer for $USD3,200 a month. To give you some idea of how expensive that is, the average price for a new house in the United States in 1956 was $USD11,700.</p>

<h4>Now</h4>

<p>60 years later, the following image is the best-selling USB stick on the USA-based Amazon site. For $USD7.99 you can purchase a &quot;drive&quot; that will hold 32Gb of information and weighs around 20 grams. Just how much of a change that is, is demonstrated on the following page.</p>

<p>The following content description from the Digital technologies subject</p>
<blockquote>Acquire, store and validate different types of data, and use a range of software to interpret and visualise data to create information (<a href="http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/curriculum/contentdescription/ACTDIP016">ACTDIP016</a>)</blockquote>
<p>This content description expects students to be able to perform do a range of tasks with data, including being able to visualise data to create information.  <a href="http://learningwithsaranna.wixsite.com/thedigitalworld">This page</a> includes details and resources for a research project  that is &quot;designed for year 6 students to investigate and present information about an emerging digital technology&quot;.   </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> it makes of the <a href="http://big6.com/">&quot;Big6&quot; 6-stage model</a> designed to help &quot;anyone solve problems or make decisions by using information&quot;. A potential pedagogical approach that might be useful.</p>
<p>Let's use this as an exercise to illustrate the unstable nature of digital technology.</p>

        <head><h1>Present information about data storage technology</h1></head>

<p>An earlier page provided you with some data on the evolution of storage technologies. That data is summarised in the following table.</p>

<table class="dj_table">
  <tr class="dj_table_header">
    <th> Year </th>
    <th> Cost </th>
    <th> average new house price </th>
    <th> Weight </th>
    <th> Storage capacity </th>
  </tr>
  <tr class="table_row">
    <td> 1956
    </td> <td> $USD3200 per/month
    </td> <td> $USD11,700
    </td> <td> 1 ton
    </td> <td> 5Mb </td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="table_alt_row">
    <td> 2016
    </td> <td> $USD7.99
    </td> <td> $USD247,700
    </td> <td> ~20 grams
    </td> <td> 32Gb </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The data presented in that table isn't exactly impactful. How might we &quot;visualise this data to create information&quot;? There are many different possibilities - <a href="https://www.sisense.com/blog/10-useful-ways-visualize-data-examples/">this page</a> outlines a few fairly simple ones.</p>
<p>I've decided to use Excel - spreadsheet software - to produce the following graph to show the difference between data and information</p>

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/28702955116/in/dateposted-public/" title="USB versus IBM 350 disc"><img alt="USB versus IBM 350 disc" height="464" src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8794/28702955116_ebaa6e702b_z.jpg" width="640"></a><script async charset="utf-8" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js"></script>

<p>Chances are you can't even see the bar for the 1956 storage device. You might be able to see if you download and open <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14025788/edm8006/2016/004/Visualising%20information.xlsx">the Excel spreadsheet</a> I used.</p>
<p>The unstable nature of digital technology has created a change so vast that it is difficult to visualise. The 2016 simple USB stick can hold 6400 times more data than then 1 ton 1956 device. </p>
<p>As a comparison, Saturn has a diameter only 9.5 times bigger than Earth. You could fit 764 planets like Earth into Saturn. </p> 

<h4>But wait there is more...</h4>

<p>You can currently purchase <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/highest-capacity-usb-flash-drives/">high capacity USB drives</a> that will hold 200,000 times the data as the 1956 device.</p>

   <div class="dj_activity">
     <p>Time for you to generate some visualisations of the other information from the table above. (This might be a little challenging)</p>
      <p>Use <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14025788/edm8006/2016/004/Visualising%20information.xlsx">the Excel spreadsheet</a> I used (or other means) to produce visualisations of the following relationships (perhaps similar to the graph above)</p>
      <ol>
        <li> How much has the weight of storage devices changed between 1956 and 2016?</li>
        <li> How much has the average USA house price changed between 1956 and 2016?</li>
        <li> Do you notice any difference between how much the characteristics related to the digital technology (weight and storage capacity) has changed, versus how much the characteristic related to the physical technology (house price) has changed? </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Hints:</p>
     <ul>
       <li> For Questions 1 and 2 you might like to treat the Storage example in the spreadsheet as an algorithm that has the following steps 
           <ol>
             <li> Present the complete data
             </li> <li> Convert the numbers into the same unit (e.g. change storage capacity figures so they are both in Mb; change the weights so they are both in grams)
             </li> <li> Create a table with just the year and the data you're interested in. 
             </li> <li> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=excel+create+chart">Create a chart</a> with Excel of that data </li>
           </ol>
            <p>A simple way to do this would be to create a new sheet and copy and paste the content from the storage sheet.</p>
        </li>
       <li> For question 3, it may be helpful to read about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_magnitude">order of magnitude</a> and think about how digital technologies are meant to much more rapidly changing than physical technologies (like a house).</li>
       <li> If you are really stuck, then you might want to take a solution at <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14025788/edm8006/2016/004/Visualising%20information_solution.xlsx">a one solution</a>. </li>
