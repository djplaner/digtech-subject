<p>How did you go in the <a href="http://localhost:8080/moodle/mod/quiz/view.php?id=1087">&quot;What do you know and feel about digital technologies&quot; quiz</a> from earlier in this ramble? In particular, how many of the &quot;Is this a digital technology&quot; questions did you get right?</p>
<p>A version of this quiz is used in another course. That quiz has 10 questions, each asking the learners to identify whether or not an object is a digital technology. In the first half of 2016 this quiz was taken by almost 300 students.  The following graph shows the breakdown of grades achieved.  The graph shows that</p>
<ul>
  <li> Just over 60 students (~19.5%) got 10 out of 10. </li>
  <li> Just over 80 students (~25.5%) got 5 out of 10. </li>
</ul>

<h4>The following books</h4>

<p>The aim of the books in this section of the ramble - What is digital technology and how might you teach the Digital technologies subject - is to help you answer both these questions. First, to develop your content knowledge so you know what is unique and different about digital technologies. Not only can this knowledge help you develop learning experiences around the Digital technology subject, but it can also help you understand and improve your experiences with digital technologies. This knowledge is then linked to the Digital technologies content descriptions and examples of how people have planned to teach the Digital technologies subject.</p>

<p>At various times the books in this section of the ramble will point to a number of different resources. These resources will come from two main sources.</p>

<h4>Digital technologies resources</h4>

<p>The USQ course <a href="http://www.usq.edu.au/course/specification/2016/EDP4130-S1-2016-ONC-SPRNG.html">EDP4130, Technology Curriculum and Pedagogy</a> is part of the current Bachelor of Education. In that course, students spend an entire semester looking at the Technologies learning area. As part of that course they are <a href="http://course.albion.id.au/edp4130/2016_s1/assess/assign.html">required to develop resources</a> to support the Australian Curriculum: Technologies learning area.</p>
<p>Samples of those resources are available online, including resources for:</p>
<ul>
  <li> the <a href="http://course.albion.id.au/edp4130/2016_s1/assess/di_resources.html">Digital technologies subject</a>; and, </li>
  <li> the <a href="http://course.albion.id.au/edp4130/2016_s1/assess/de_resources.html">Design and technologies subject</a>. </li>
</ul>

<p> Each of these pages include a list of content descriptions from the two subjects from the Technologies learning area. For each listed content description there are pointers off to resources produced by USQ students. These resources should be designed to help teachers develop learning experiences for these content descriptions.</p>
<p>The following books will make use of some of these resources to help you further develop your knowledge of digital technologies, but also gain an understanding of how some have proposed that aspects of the Digital technologies subject could be taught.</p>
<p>You might find it useful to look at the resources for the Design and technologies subject.</p>

<h4>Computational thinking: philosophy and practice</h4>

<p>The following books will also make brief use of <a href="https://lor.usq.edu.au/usq/items/11cdcb09-6eb9-4ba5-afb2-c50636cfa8b0/1/">this reading (Fluck and Bower, 2016)</a>. The chapter as a whole examines the key concept of computational thinking. A concept that is perhaps amongst the most challenging for many people within the Digital technologies subject.</p>
<p>You may find it useful to spend more time reading the rest of this chapter.</p>

    <p>Now might be a good time to download the PDF file for <a href="https://lor.usq.edu.au/usq/items/11cdcb09-6eb9-4ba5-afb2-c50636cfa8b0/1/">the reading</a>.</p>

<p>Time to start thinking about digital technologies.</p>
<p> As you&#39;ve no doubt noticed there is a strong connection within the Technologies learning area. A strong connection between the Design and technologies subject, and the Digital technologies subject. For example, the table <a href="http://localhost:8080/moodle/mod/book/view.php?id=1090&amp;chapterid=3708">on this page</a> from the Technologies learning area showing the similarities between the strands for the two subjects.</p>
<p>For many people this begs the questions:</p>
<ul> <li> Are digital technologies any different from other technologies? </li>
  <li> If so, what are the differences? </li>
</ul>
<p>Brantley-Dias &amp; Ertmer (2013) pose the following</p>
<blockquote>The fundamental question, then, is whether these types of digital tools are sufficiently different from other, more traditional tools, to require their own category of knowledge</blockquote>
<p>Kirschner (2015) is not convinced that digital technologies are any different, nor that they should be treated any different.</p>
<p>Due to the existence of a separate Digital technologies subject, the framers of the Australian Curriculum seem to disagree. There is a difference.</p>
<p>But what is that difference?</p>


<div class="dj_task">
   <div class="dj_task_title"><p>What do you think?</p></div>
   <div class="dj_activity">
     <p>What do you think right now? Can you identify the difference between digital technologies and non-digital technologies? Why might there a separate subject for digital technologies?</p>
      <p>As you work through the rest of this ramble, think about these questions and revisit them at the end.</p>

<p>The diagram below represents a model of digital technologies. It aims to identify the fundamental properties and the nature of all digital technologies. </p>
<p>It proposes that the fundamental properties for all digital technologies are: data homogenisation and reprogrammability. It is these combination of properties that make a technology &quot;digital&quot;.</p>
<p>The model also proposes that these fundamental properties combine to create the distinct nature of digital technologies. The model below suggests that all digital technologies, to varying levels, are: unstable, opaque, and protean.</p>
<p>The proposition is that these properties and nature are what distinguish digital technologies from other types of technologies. Non-digital technologies do not have the same fundamental properties, and are thus do not have the nature of digital technologies.</p>
<p>The remaining books in this ramble will use this model to:</p>
<ol>
  <li> help you develop an understanding of the important concepts associated with digital technologies; and, </li>
  <li> connect this understanding with the Digital technologies subject.</li>
</ol>

<h4>The model</h4>

   <p>Ignoring digital technologies for the moment, what is your current understanding of the following words:</p>

       <li>    unstable; </li>
