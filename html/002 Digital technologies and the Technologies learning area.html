<p>Amongst the first suggestions you encountered last week was to keep a <a href="http://localhost:8080/moodle/mod/book/view.php?id=1077&amp;chapterid=3678">collection of questions</a> at the forefront of your mind as you worked through last week's ramble. Answers to these questions represent some of the important knowledge for you to take away from last week. Due to the connections between the <a href="http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/technologies/introduction">Technologies learning area</a>, the <a href="http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/technologies/design-and-technologies/curriculum/f-10">Design and technologies subject</a>, and the <a href="http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/technologies/digital-technologies/curriculum/f-10">Digital technologies subject</a>, you will build on your answers to those questions as you work through this week's ramble.</p>
<p>Those questions were</p>
<ul>
  <li> What is this learning area/subject about? 
      <ul>
          <Li>  What are its big themes?  </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Why do students need to learn it?  
       <p> What is its relevant to them and their lives?</p>
  </li>
  <li>  How does it fit with the rest of what you have to teach? </li>
   <li>   What are you expected to help students learn? 
            <ul> 
              <li> Knowledge?  </li>
             <li>  Skills?  </li>
           </ul>
    </li>
   <li>  What resources are available to help you and your learners? </li>
</ul>

<p>The following briefly revises some of what was covered last week to encourage you to reflect upon the quality of your answers to the above questions.</p>

<div class="dj_task">
   <div class="dj_task_title"><p>Why do they need to learn it?</p></div>
   <div class="dj_activity">
<p> The "Why do students need to learn it?" question is left unanswered in the following. What was your answer? </p>
     <p>In a couple of years, when you are a teacher, what are you going to say when a parent comes up to you and asks</p><blockquote>Why are you letting my son waste his time at school playing with paper, glue and wood?  Why aren't you helping him learn mathematics and science? The stuff that's going to get him a job?</blockquote>

<p>The big theme for the Technologies learning area - including both its subjects - is technology, broadly defined. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/technologies/key-ideas">key ideas</a> for the learning area are:
</p><ul>
  <li> Creating preferred futures - listed as the overarching idea.
  </li> <li>    Project management.
  </li> <li>    Thinking in technologies, which includes:
            <ul>
              <li>  Systems thinking. </li>
            </ul></li>   Design thinking. 
               Computational thinking - a topic to be expanded this week. 
            </ul>
  

<p>The <a href="http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/technologies/structure">structure</a> of the Technologies learning area is summarised in the following image.  The image shows the themes and the two subjects that make up the Technologies learning area.</p>
<p>Last week you looked at the Design and technologies subject.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/technologies/structure">Technologies learning area's structure page</a> gives a high level summary of what is to be learned.</p>
<p>Last week the <a href="http://localhost:8080/moodle/mod/book/view.php?id=1083">difference between declarative and procedural knowledge</a> and <a href="http://localhost:8080/moodle/mod/book/view.php?id=1083&amp;chapterid=3700">how they fit together</a> was briefly described. </p>
<p>It was explained that in the Technologies learning area what learners are expected to learned is divided into two strands:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Knowledge and understanding - declarative knowledge. </li>
  <li>  Processes and production skills - procedural knowledge. </li>
</ol>
<p>The following table (adapted from the <a href="http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/technologies/structure">Technologies learning area's structure page</a>) gives a high level overview of the two strands for the two subjects within the Technologies learning area.</p>
<p>Last week you were <a href="http://localhost:8080/moodle/mod/book/view.php?id=1083&amp;chapterid=3698">(re-)introduced to the notion of content descriptions</a> in the Australian Curriculum documents. You were also asked to <a href="http://localhost:8080/moodle/mod/book/view.php?id=1083&amp;chapterid=3701">find and use two content descriptions</a> from the Design and technologies subject.</p>

p>This week you will</p>
<ol>
  <li> Explore where the Digital technologies subject fits with the other parts of the curriculum. </li>
  <li> Build your content knowledge around digital technologies (connected to the strands and content descriptions of the Digital technologies subject. </li>
  <li> Start exploring the content descriptions and what they look like in the classroom. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Curriculum, pedagogy and being creative</h3>

<p>This week and last week largely focus on introducing you to the learning area, the subjects, and the curriculum. This defines <em>What is to be taught</em> (the content).</p>
<p>In theory, this is different from pedagogy - <em>How it is to be learned/taught</em>.</p>
<p>In reality, separating the two out is not always possible, nor desirable. As <a href="http://localhost:8080/moodle/mod/book/view.php?id=1083&amp;chapterid=3696">mentioned last week</a> Shulman (1987) identified the combination of pedagogy and content knowledge (PCK) as the core knowledge of a teacher.</p>
<p>This week, as with last week, you will see some examples of pedagogy mixed in with the curriculum (content) knowledge, but throughout the rest of the semester you should be looking and thinking about the different types of pedagogies that can be used to teach Digital technologies.</p>
