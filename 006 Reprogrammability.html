<p>Data homogenisation does not end with data like audio files, movies, or this book.</p>
<p> Digital technologies are based on a structure (often called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture">the Von Neumann architecture</a>) that allows the creation of programs. Programs are collections of instructions that when combined creatively direct the digital technology to achieve some task. </p>
<p> Everything a digital technology does is a result of a program.</p>
<p>Due to data homogenization (all data is represented as 0s and 1s) these collections of instructions are also stored digitally. Meaning that, in theory, it&#39;s possible to view and manipulate computer programs in much the same way as you do other digital data. </p>
<p> In particular, digital technologies have a processing unit that will decode these instructions (stored as binary numbers) and attempt to carry out the task the instructions specify. Importantly the programs used by digital technologies can - in the right situations - be changed. Hopefully for the better. A digital technology is reprogrammable. What a digital technology offers to the user does not need to be limited by its current function.</p>
<p> For Yoo, Henfridsson, &amp; Lyytinen (2010) this means that</p>
<blockquote> As long as users agree on the meaning of the digital data and have the wits to come up with new instructions to manipulate the data, the architecture offers flexibility in the way data is manipulated. (p. 726)</blockquote>

<h4>Algorithms</h4>

<p>Computer programs are examples of algorithms (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTD2d4KdRKE" class="nomediaplugin">this 50 second video for a definition of algorithm</a>). Algorithms don't need to be applied only to computers. Algorithms can help you win at games like chocolate/chili roulette.</p>

<h4>How to play chocolate/chili roulette</h4>

<p>Popularised by <a href="https://twitter.com/marcusdusautoy/status/199100786976886784">mathematician Marcus du Sautoy</a> chocolate/chili roulette is a game played between two people. The aim is to avoid having to eat a chili. The rules for chocolate/chili roulette are:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Place 13 chocolates and 1 chili in a jar. </li>
  <li> Each participant takes turns removing chocolates from the jar. 
       <p>But they are only allowed to remove either 1, 2 or 3 chocolates each turn.</p> </li>
  <li> You continue playing until there are no chocolates left, and someone (the loser) has to take (and eat) the chili.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can watch this game being played <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4d7fNjCQ4A" class="nomediaplugin">in this video</a>.  It starts at about 3m30s into the video.</p>

<h4>How to win chocolate/chili roulette with an algorithm</h4>

<p>The value of algorithms can be demonstrated by using an algorithm that, if used, ensures that you always win. The algorithm (shown in the video above) is:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Go first and take 1 chocolate. </li>
  <li> Watch the other player take chocolates. </li>
  <li> Take (4 minus however many the other player took in step 2) chocolates.
        <p>e.g. if they took 3 chocolates, then you take 4-3 = 1 chocolate. If they take 1 chocolate, you take 4 -1 = 3 chocolates.</p> </li>
  <li> Go back to step 2 and repeat until the other play has to eat chili. </li>
</ol>

<h4>Teaching reprogrammability without technology</h4>

<p>This is an example of how the fundamental idea of reprogrammability - algorithms - can be introduced without the use of digital technologies.   Most of the big ideas associated with the digital technologies subject can be introduced without using digital technologies. This can be especially helpful with the earlier years.</p>
<p> However, I would argue that it is important that students later get the opportunity to apply this knowledge and skills with digital technologies. The speed and nature of digital technologies significantly elevate what is possible.</p>

<h4>Seymour Papert and programming as a better use for computers in education</h4>

<p>This book is being written in early August 2016. Just under a week ago <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2016/seymour-papert-pioneer-of-constructionist-learning-dies-0801">Professor Seymour Papert</a> passed away. Papert is widely recognised as the father of educational computing. You will see him referenced later in this ramble. His influence and contribution is too broad (and challenging to the status quo - even today) to go into detail here. Instead, I'll mention a single quote that is relevant somewhat to the example of this page.</p>
<p>Note: you can download a copy of Papert's seminal 1980 book - Mindstorms: children, computers and powerful ideas - <a href="http://dl.acm.org.ezproxy.usq.edu.au/citation.cfm?id=1095592">via this link</a> (while a student at USQ).</p>
<br clear="all" />
<blockquote>In many schools today, the phrase "computer-aided instruction"
means making the computer teach the child. One might say the computer is being used to program the child. In my vision, the child programs the computer and, in doing so, both acquires a sense of mastery over a piece of the most modern and powerful technology and establishes an intimate contact with some of the deepest ideas from science, from mathematics, and from the art of intellectual model building. (Papert, 1980, p. 5)</blockquote>


<p>The idea of this quote is that by engaging students in programming (creating artifacts - related to Papert's learning theory - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructionism_(learning_theory)">constructionism</a>) they are able to learn more and differently than the most common applications of computing in education.</p>

<p>Earlier in this book the chocolate/chili game was introduced as one way of help students learning concepts and skills from the Digital technologies subject without having to use digital technologies. This can be especially useful in the early years or other contexts where students are still learning about how to use digital technologies. The aim of this page is to illustrate that there is also value to be gained from using digital technologies. The speed and nature of digital technologies add something that is not possible to achieve without them.</p>

<h4>A simple algorithm</h4>

<p>What follows is a simple algorithm that you or your students could follow. </p>
<ol>
  <li> Draw a triangle.
  </li> <li>   Label the three vertices (corners) of the triangle.
  </li> <li>   Place a dot in the middle of the triangle - call this current dot
  </li> <li>   Randomly pick one of the vertices
  </li> <li>   Place another dot, half way between current dot and the vertix you picked
  </li> <li>   Call this new dot  current dot
  </li> <li>   Go back to step #4 
  </li>
</ol>
<p>If you keep working on this algorithm for long enough, it will produce a surprisingly cool pattern.</p>

<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/535226/">This page</a> allows you to run this algorithm and view the pattern that emerges. The algorithm is written in a language called Scratch. Scratch is a visual programming language that is often used in schools to introduce people to the concepts of algorithms and programming.

<h3>About Scratch</h3>
<p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> is not only a programming environment, it is also a large and active community of children and others sharing the programs that they write with Scratch. 
</p><p>For example, there are many different Scratch programs that have been written to implement this algorithm. <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/535226/">The example</a> mentioned here runs quite slowly, but provides a good illustration of the algorithm in action and an explanation. It identifies this algorithm as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_triangle">Sierpinski&#39;s triangle</a>.  The image below is the Scratch code that the example project uses to implement this algorithm.</p>
<p>If you visit <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/search/projects?q=sierpinski+triangle">this page</a>, you can see a range of different Scratch projects from the Scratch community that implement various forms of Sierpinski&#39;s triangle.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t worry, most of the Scratch programs in the community are not so mathematical.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, since reprogrammability is a fundamental property of digital technologies, the Digital technology subject has a significant focus on knowledge and skills associated with algorithms and programming. The following table gives one idea of where reprogrammability fits.</p>

<p>The Digital technologies subject has students starting to develop their knowledge and skills of algorithms and reprogrammability from the very start of their schooling. The following content descriptions are both from the Foundation to Year 2 band.</p>

<h4>Knowledge and understanding</h4>

<p>The first is from the Knowledge and Understanding strand. In terms of reprogrammability, this content description expects students to be able to recognise that digital technologies follow instructions or commands.</p>
<blockquote> Recognise and explore digital systems (hardware and software components) for a purpose (<a href="http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/technologies/digital-technologies/curriculum/f-10?layout=1#cdcode=ACTDIK001&amp;level=F-2">ACTDIK001</a>)</blockquote>

<h4>Processes and production skills</h4>

<p>The next content description is from the Processes and Production skills strand. It expects the students to be able to develop the skill required to engage with simple sequences of instructions (algorithms). In this case, by being able to &quot;follow, describe and represent&quot; them. </p>
<blockquote> Follow, describe and represent a sequence of steps and decisions (algorithms) needed to solve simple problems (<a href="http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/technologies/digital-technologies/curriculum/f-10?layout=1#cdcode=ACTDIP004&amp;level=F-2">ACTDIP004</a>)</blockquote>

<h4>Sample resources</h4>

<p>Some resources prepared by previous USQ students around these content descriptors, including:</p>
<ul> 
  <li> <p><a href="http://amanda0234.wixsite.com/technology-resources/blank-1">A page</a> that provides a 3 step guide to teaching students about algorithms and digital devices. </p><p> It includes examples such as: visually representing the steps involved in <a href="http://media.wix.com/ugd/9e28ef_b37ce2d110954c71bc7e365b3cea8ef4.pdf">bath time</a>, or <a href="http://media.wix.com/ugd/9e28ef_d703d8cdd2d1435190127f5714646eaf.pdf">drawing a cat</a>. It also mentioned Bee-bots and links to a related design brief.</p> </li>
  <li><p><a href="http://u1015674.weebly.com/digital-technologies.html">A page</a> focused on using Beebots.</p> </li>
