# digtech-subject

A "path" offering one way into the [Digital Technologies subject](http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/technologies/digital-technologies/rationale) from [the Australian Curriculum](http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/technologies/).

## About the content

The content here is 

- based on learning materials produced in 2016 for the University of Southern Queensland course [EDM8006, Curriculum and Pedagogical Studies 2: Arts & Technologies](http://www.usq.edu.au/course/specification/2016/EDM8006-S2-2016-WEB-TWMBA.html).  
- a sequence of "books" (a collection of web pages) that were designed to fit within the Moodle course site for EDM8006. Hence there is mention of Moodle-based resources such as quizzes and readings.
- the second of two weeks produced using this approach. The first week introduced the broader Technologies learning area and the Design and technologies subject.

## History

### Origins

Initially, this repository is intended to be a test space for the technology being developed as part of the [Moodle open Book module project](https://djon.es/blog/research/the-moodle-open-book-module-project/). However, it may form the basis for more exploration around the integration of open educational practice into initial teacher education.

### Leveraging it further

Next, the idea is to convert it markdown for integration into other projects/technologies.
