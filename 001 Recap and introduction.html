<p>Welcome to digital technologies!!!</p>
<p> How does that make you react? That's a small part of what this week will explore.</p>
<h3>Last week</h3>

<p>The focus last week was on you gaining an overview of the Australian Curriculum Technologies learning area, which in turn contains two subjects: Design and technologies, and Digital technologies. Last week you became familiar with the common structure of the learning area and the two subjects, before then exploring the Design and technologies subject in more detail.</p>

<h3>This week</h3>

<p>This week you will build on this knowledge of the Technologies learning area and use it to explore the Digital technologies subject. In doing so, you will:</p>
<ul>
  <li> think about your knowledge and feelings about digital technologies;
  </li> <li>   develop an understanding of the many different ways in which digital technologies are part of the Australian Curriculum and what you are expected to do in the classroom;
  </li> <li>    learn about a particular model of digital technologies;
  </li> <li>    develop and apply knowledge of digital technologies for your own purposes;
  </li> <li>    familiarise yourself with ways in which aspects of the Digital technologies subject are covered in classrooms; and,
  </li> <li>    explore the Digital technologies subject in more detail.
</li></ul>

<p>But before you dive into that. How about you complete <a href="http://localhost:8080/moodle/mod/quiz/view.php?id=1087">a quiz</a>?</p>
<p><a href="http://localhost:8080/moodle/mod/quiz/view.php?id=1087">The following quiz</a> consists of 13 questions, either multiple-choice or true-false. It is designed to get you thinking about what you know about digital technologies and your perceptions of them. The rest of this ramble will revisit and expand upon these questions with the aim of deepening your learning.</p>

<h3>Some advice</h3>

<p>Some random advice for this week:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <p>Don&#39;t do it all at once.</p>
     <p>As with last week, you don&#39;t need to complete all of this ramble in one sitting. Instead, do plan to work through a bit at a time. Giving enough time between starting again to reflect upon what you&#39;ve experienced.</p> </li>

  <li> <p>Have a &quot;somewhere&quot; in mind.</p> 
       <p>As you work through this ramble have a particular learning context and teaching requirement (your &quot;somewhere&quot;) in mind. Read the following materials and engage in the activities with that somewhere in mind.</p>
  </li>

  <li> <p>Think of yourself and your needs.</p>
       <p>What follows can not and is not designed to cover everything you will need to know about digital technologies and the Digital technologies subject. The intent is to provide a foundation to help with your own, on-going explorations.</p>
        <p>Those explorations start now. As you work through the following, think of yourself and your strengths and weaknesses. Identify what more you need to know, and give some thought to how you are going to build those strengths and address your weaknesses.</p>

  </li><li> <p>Ask questions and question what you read.</p>
        <p>At any stage, feel free to ask questions about what you&#39;ve read. Also don&#39;t take what you read for granted. Challenge what we and other say. Challenge us in the open, open up discussion.</p>
        <p><a href="http://localhost:8080/moodle/mod/forum/view.php?id=1086">The digital technologies forum</a> is one place to ask questions and discuss.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
