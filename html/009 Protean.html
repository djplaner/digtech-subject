<p>The protean nature of digital technologies arises from a combination of their fundamental properties and provides a strong link to the purpose of the Digital technologies subject.</p>
<p>The following is adapted from Jones and Schneider (2016).</p>

<p>Seymour Papert in his book Mindstorms (Papert, 1980) describes the computer as &quot;the Proteus of machines&quot; (p. xxi) since the essence of a computer is its &quot;universality, its power to simulate. Because it can take on a thousand forms and can serve a thousand functions, it can appeal to a thousand tastes&quot; (p. xxi). This is a view echoed by Alan Kay (1984) and his discussion of the &quot;protean nature of the computer&quot; (p. 59) as &quot;the first metamedium, and as such has degrees of freedom and expression never before encountered&quot; (p. 59). In describing the design of the first personal computer, Kay and Goldberg (1977) outline the challenge of producing a computer that is useful for everyone. Their solution was to provide a foundation technology and sufficient general tools to allow &quot;ordinary users to casually and easily describe their desires for a specific tool&quot; (Kay &amp; Goldberg, 1977, p. 41).</p>
<p>Sadly, while the graphical user interfaces of contemporary digital technologies were inspired by the work of Kay and his colleagues, few of them (until recently) have supported the idea of digital technology being protean. A problem that has led Ruskhoff (2010) or suggesting that &quot;instead of optimizing our machines for humanity - or even the benefit of some particular group - we are optimizing humans for machinery&quot; (p. 15).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/technologies/digital-technologies/rationale">The rationale</a> for the Digital technologies subject includes the following</p>
<blockquote>The Australian Curriculum: Digital Technologies empowers students to shape change by influencing how contemporary and emerging information systems and practices are applied to meet current and future needs. A deep knowledge and understanding of information systems enables students to be creative and discerning decision-makers when they select, use and manage data, information, processes and digital systems to meet needs and shape preferred futures....The subject helps students to become innovative creators of digital solutions,</blockquote>

<p>The aim of the Digital technologies subject is to help students see digital technologies as protean.  A technology that allows them to &quot;optimise our machines for humanity&quot; (Rushkoff, 2010, p. 15). That allows them to shape preferred futures.</p>

   <div class="dj_activity">
     <p>Increasingly you have experiences using digital technologies for a range of different activities. You have some experiences using digital technologies for learning. For example, in this course. For example,</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Do you get annoyed by all the email messages from the Study Desk and USQ? </li>
   <li> Have you had any problems keeping track of many different passwords? </li>
  <li>   Are you getting tired of reading this text on a screen with black text on a white background? </li>

<p>Protean digital technologies mean that you should be able to get the technology to do what you want, to change it.</p>
<p>For example, the following is from a forum post by a student in another course I teach. It outlines a problem you may be experiencing</p>
<blockquote>Because this course does not have a text book and everything is online, try inverting the colour of your text (white text on black background instead of black on white). This makes reading large volumes of text on a screen easier for your eyes.</blockquote>

<p>Well given digital technologies are protean, reprogrammable, and all data is just 0s and 1s, it should be possible to change the colour of the background.  This student described her solution this way</p>
<blockquote> I simply looked it up on Google on how to invert Google Chrome. No more headaches and no 5 minute break needed every 8-10 minutes. Woo!</blockquote>

<p>If you have children, then you have almost certainly heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft">Minecraft</a>. It is a computer game in which players inhabit an open world (a sandbox). A sandbox in which anything can be created. </p>
<p>For example, in Ireland in 2016 there is a competition behind held for schools to use Minecraft to represent Irelands past, present, and future. To help the organisers have created a number of Minecraft worlds that represent Irish buildings. You can download <a href="http://www.mindrising.ie/downloads">them here</a>.</p>
<p>But beyond this, people have <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/104029-Player-Creates-Working-Computer-in-Minecraft">created computers</a> that run in Minecraft. That&#39;s right, they are playing a game (Minecraft) on their real computer. But using the principles of computer design, they are able to use resources from within the game to create an object within the game that will work as a computer. YouTube has a number of videos of people showing off their Minecraft computers. There is even <a class="nomediaplugin" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LElYFSglR-g">this video</a> that explains how these Minecraft computers work.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s not stop there. How about the <a href="http://www.techtimes.com/articles/112733/20151202/this-mobile-phone-built-within-minecraft-actually-works.htm">Minecraft smart phone</a> that you can use to browse the web, place video calls, and (of course) take and post selfies.</p>

<p>What about <a href="http://www.pikazoapp.com/">Pikazo</a>? Have you heard of Pikazo?</p>
<p> Pikazo is an app (and a raft of complicate supporting digital technologies) that allow you to combine two images to create a new one. But what is really different about Pikazo is that uses the second image as a style. It tries to re-create the first image using the style of the second image.</p>

<h4>What Pikazo does</h4>
<p>The following image provides an example. The two images used here were the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa">Mona Lisa</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scream">The Scream</a> </p>

<p>On the left, the image below shows the Mona Lisa "re-painted" by Pikazo in the style of The Scream. On the right, is The Scream "re-painted" by Pikazo in the style of the Mona Lisa.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.pikazoapp.com/">Pikazo site</a> has a gallery of additional images.</p>

<p>One of the key concepts in the Digital technologies subject is computational thinking. <a href="http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/technologies/digital-technologies/glossary#C">The Digital technologies glossary</a> defines computational thinking this way</p>
<blockquote>A problem-solving method that involves various techniques and strategies in order to solve problems that can be implemented by digital technologies, such as organising data logically, breaking down problems into components, and the design and use of algorithms, patterns and models.</blockquote>

<p>The earlier example of solving the problem of reading text on-screen with a white background, is an example of computational thinking. It&#39;s use problem-solving to identify how to effectively solve a problem with digital technologies.</p>
