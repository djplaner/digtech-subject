<p>Koehler and Mishra (2009) draw on Turkle (1995) to define opaque as &quot;the inner workings are hidden from users&quot;. Turkle (1995) talks about people having &quot;become accustomed to opaque technology&quot;. Meaning that as the power of digital technologies have increased we no longer see the inner workings of the technology as they&#39;ve become hidden behind graphical user interfaces.</p>
<p>This is important because of reprogrammability. </p>
<p>Every digital technology is programed. It has been designed to work a certain way. If you understand how the digital technology is programmed, you can predict how it will work, you can problem solve with it. Ben-Ari and Yeshno (2006) found that people with appropriate conceptual models of digital technologies were better able to analyse and solve problems. While learners without appropriate conceptual models were limited to aimless trial and error; and, had higher levels of anxiety.</p>

<h4>It causes anxiety</h4>

<p>Do you the following images capture how you often feel about digital technologies?</p>

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/27871979351/in/dateposted-public/" title="Perceptions of computers"><img alt="Perceptions of computers" height="375" src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/8/7430/27871979351_e81508a612.jpg" width="500"></a><script async charset="utf-8" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js"></script>

<p>It appears that much of the anxiety people feel about digital technologies is due to the opaque nature of digital technology. The fact that what you see of the digital technology does not help you understand how it is programmed and how it should work.</p>
<p>A lot of the tension people feel around digital technologies are not due to their lack of knowledge, it&#39;s due to poorly designed interfaces and software.</p>

<h4>Importance to the Digital technologies subject</h4>

<p>Understanding that digital technologies tend toward the opaque and that this impacts how and what people can do with digital technologies links to a number of key aims for <a href="http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/technologies/digital-technologies/aims">the Digital technologies subject</a>. But perhaps the most obvious is this aim</p>
<blockquote>use computational thinking and the key concepts of abstraction; data collection, representation and interpretation; specification, algorithms and implementation to create digital solutions</blockquote>
<p>Opaque digital technologies are examples of poor abstraction and representation, often due to poorly designed specifications and algorithms and will eventually lead to digital solutions that are poorly implemented.</p>

<p>Let's play another game.  It's a game called Number Scrabble.  You will need someone to play against, and you will need 9 cards, from the Ace up to 9.  Lay them down like the following, from low to high.</p>

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/28120384143/in/dateposted-public/" title="scrabbleCards"><img alt="scrabbleCards" height="120" src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8889/28120384143_b3f38a20e3_z.jpg" width="640"></a>

<p>The players take turns taking one card each until they both have 3 cards. To win a player must have a set of 3 cards that add up to 15. E.g. a 9 + 4 + 2 = 15.</p>

     <p>Play the game against yourself or a colleague.  Can you think of an algorithm (just like <a href="http://localhost:8080/moodle/mod/book/view.php?id=1096&amp;chapterid=3731">chocolate/chili roulette</a>) that would ensure that you win?</p>

<p>The problem with opaque digital technologies is that it&#39;s not clear how they work. This might be due to a bad abstraction (how the algorithms underlying the program are designed) or a bad representation (how the interface of the program is designed).</p>
<p>The following is intended to show you the difference having the right abstraction (algorithm) and representation can make. It aims to show how much easier and more productive if the model underpinning a task is transparent, especially if it allows the person to draw upon existing knowledge.</p>

<h4>Number tic-tac-toe</h4>

<p>Let&#39;s play the same game - Number Scrabble - as on the last page, but rather than lay the cards out from the ace up to the 9. Lay them out in the following pattern.</p>

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/28735853145/in/dateposted-public/" title="ticTacToe"><img alt="ticTacToe" height="640" src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8243/28735853145_18ab97fee0_z.jpg" width="446"></a><script async charset="utf-8" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js"></script>

<p>When you look at the above cards, think of the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe">tic-tac-toe</a> (noughts and crosses). Just about everyone I know has played tic-tac-toe and has worked out an algorithm that ensures that they never lose.</p>

<div class="dj_task">
   <div class="dj_task_title"><p>Play number scrabble</p></div>
   <div class="dj_activity">
     <p>For each of the rows, columns and diagonals in the above image, add up the total of the 3 cards in that row, column or diagonal. Do you get the same number for each? What number? Can you see the connection between that number and number scrabble?</p>
    </div>
</div>
   
<p>By changing the representation of this problem into tic-tac-toe it&#39;s been made much easier for you to understand the structure of the game and (if you&#39;ve placed tic-tac-to before) to apply your tic-tac-toe algorithm to playing this number game.</p>
<p>What do you think would happen if you played this number scrabble against someone who didn&#39;t know about number tic-tac-toe? Who would be more likely to win?</p>

<p>The following content description from the Digital technologies subject is just one related to the opaque nature of digital technology</p>
<blockquote>Design a user interface for a digital system (<a href="http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/technologies/digital-technologies/curriculum/f-10?layout=1#cdcode=ACTDIP018&amp;level=5-6">ACTDIP018</a>)</blockquote>

<p>It includes the following elaboration as an example of what might be done</p>
<blockquote> exploring different features of user interfaces that allow people from different cultures to access information irrespective of language background,</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://edp4130rkim.weebly.com/digital-technologies.html">This page</a> contains a design brief designed to engage students in the design of a user interface and connects with Geography and the Sustainability cross-curriculum priority.</p>

<h4>Good digital technologies are not opaque</h4>

<p>The point is that it is only badly designed digital technologies that are opaque. A well-designed digital technology will be transparent to use and actually magnify the person&#39;s capability.</p>
<p>In the Digital technologies subject it is important that students learn this point and work toward an understanding of what helps make a digital technology transparent.</p>
