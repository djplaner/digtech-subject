<p style="text-align:center; font-size:small"><strong>A model of the fundamental properties and the nature of digital technologies.</strong></p>

<p>By the end of this book, you should be able to </p>
<ul>
  <li> Explain what data homogenisation is and why it is a fundamental property of digital technologies.
  </li> <li>   Identify a range of content descriptions from the Digital technologies subject that are related to the idea of data homogenisation.
  </li> <li>   Have started exploring a range of resources designed to help students learn the knowledge and skills associated with these content descriptions.
</li></ul>

<h4>Defining homogenisation</h4>

<p>The Oxford English Dictionary offers two definitions of <a href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/homogenize">homogenise</a>:</p>
<blockquote><ol>
  <li> Subject (milk) to a process in which the fat droplets are emulsified and the cream does not separate: </li>
  <li> Make uniform or similar.</li>
</ol></blockquote>

<p>With the term data homogenisation we are using the second definition. Digital technologies make data &quot;uniform or similar&quot;.</p>

<p>Whether a digital technology is allowing you to talk to friends via Skype (or smartphone or...); capture images of snow monkeys; listen to Charlie Parker; measure the temperature; analyse the social interactions in a discussion forum; or, put your students to sleep as you read from your powerpoint slides (which they're viewing via some lecture capture system) all of the data is represented as a combination of zeros and ones. All the data is digital.  All the data has been made &quot;uniform or similar&quot;. It has been homogenised.</p>
<p>The result of this is that all digital technologies are designed to manipulate 0s and 1s (digital data). This means that, in theory at least, all digital technologies can handle all data. The content has been separated from the medium (Yoo, Henfridsson &amp; Lyytinen, 2010). </p>

<h3>When data is not homogenised</h3>

<p> Analog technologies (technologies that are not digital), on the other hand, have a tight coupling between content and medium. Way back in the 1980s I bought &quot;Born in the USA&quot; on a vinyl record. When I eventually purchased a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkman Walkman I could use the vinyl record. I had to transfer the content from the vinyl record onto a cassette tape that I could play on my Walkman. I had to transfer the content into a different format. A different medium, required a different format for the content. </p>

<h3>What data is homogenised</h3>

<p>Data homogenization is the primary reason why all of the devices shown in the picture to the right can now be carried in your pocket (on your smart phone). </p>
<p>The ability for digital technologies - through data homogenisation - to enable convergence onto a single medium is further illustrated by the following 50 second video.</p>

<p>Everyone knows and has probably used <a href="http://wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>. Did you know that Wikipedia maintains a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:RecentChanges"> list of all recent changes</a> made to Wikipedia? It lists which page was changed, what was changed, the type of change, when it happened, and who made the change. Given the huge number of people editing Wikipedia at any one time there are always new recent changes.</p>

<div class="dj_task">
   <div class="dj_task_title"><p>Required resources</p></div>
   <div class="dj_activity">
     <p>Visit the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:RecentChanges">Wikipedia recent changes page</a> and look at the most recent changes. Now refresh or reload the page. Did you see a change? Refresh it again.</p>
     <p><a href="http://codepen.io/Krinkle/pen/laucI/?editors=0010">This page</a> shows a different representation of the recent changes that is updated live. </p>
   </div>

<h4>Link to data homogenisation</h4>

<p>The data being displayed is stored somewhere as binary numbers (i.e. collections of zeros and ones). Remember, all data with digital technologies is reduced to binary numbers. That's data homogenisation.</p>
<p>The recent changes page is showing that data as a list of text. The digital technology has looked at the binary numbers and translated it into text that we can read.</p>
<p>However, while we can read it, it's not the best way the data could be represented. Especially, if our aim is to get a feel for how often Wikipedia is changing and how.</p>

<h4>Looking for a better representation</h4>

<p>Do you think it would be easier to follow if this information was represented using images and sound? What if the images we quite relaxing to watch, especially if it was combined with ambient music?</p>
<p>Given the combination of data homogenisation and reprogramability (looking at this next) properties of digital technology, it is possible to manipulate data and represent it in different forms.</p>

<h4>Listening to wikipedia</h4>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listen_to_Wikipedia">Listen to Wikipedia</a> is a piece of software that translates the recent changes to Wikipedia into &quot;a display of visuals and sound&quot;.
<p>You can watch Listen to Wikpedia <a href="http://listen.hatnote.com/">on the web</a> or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/listen-to-wikipedia/id832934300?mt=8">as an app</a>. However, this is a free service and this year it's been somewhat unreliable (it doesn't always work). To get around that problem, the following video shows you what Listen to Wikipedia looks and sounds like.</p>

<p>The combination of data homogenisation and reprogrammability (more on this next) - the fundamental properties of digital technologies - provide digital technologies with its true power to collect, manage, manipulate and analyse data of just about anything. Not surprisingly these form a key part of the digital technologies subject. </p>
<p> 
The following table provides an overview of the strands and content for the digital technologies subject (adapted from <a href="http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/technologies/digital-technologies/structure">this page</a> from Digital technology subject). The content of the Digital technologies subject strongly connected with data homogenisation and related issues are shown in red. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It's not possible to make 100% clear distinctions about what part of the subject does or does not cover data homogenisation. The other parts of the Digital technologies subject does make use of data homogenisation to varying levels, the following suggests that it's not the primary focus.</p>

<h4>A lesson plan sequence</h4>

<p><a href="http://w0075657.wixsite.com/katem/digital-technologies-resource">This lesson sequence</a> produced by a USQ student is designed to help Year 5 or 6 students learn about this content description from the Digital technologies subject.</p>
<blockquote>Examine how whole numbers are used to represent all data in digital systems (<a href="http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/technologies/digital-technologies/curriculum/f-10?layout=1#cdcode=ACTDIK015&amp;level=5-6">ACTDIK015</a>) </blockquote>

<p>There are numerous other content descriptions from the Digital technology subject that connect with data homogenization, explained on the following page.</p>

<h4>Activities and worksheets</h4>

<a href="http://littlemeiklejohn.wixsite.com/edp4130-resource2">This site</a> provides background information, two whole class activities and a worksheet to support teachers introducing the concept of binary numbers in response to the above content description. It includes a video that explains binary numbers.

<p>As shown on the table on <a href="http://localhost:8080/moodle/mod/book/view.php?id=1095&amp;chapterid=3724">a previous page</a>, aspects of data homogenisation can be found in both the Knowledge and Understanding, and the Processes and Production Skills strands from the Digital technologies subject.  The following is a list of content descriptions that are somewhat connected with data homogenisation. There are two broad groupings of content descriptions in the following, including</p>
<ol>
  <li> Understanding how data homogenisation works (e.g. ACTDIK024). </li>
  <li> Using digital systems to manipulate data and take advantage of data homogenisation (e.g. ACTDIP003). </li>
</ol>
<p>These two groupings of content descriptions are based on the two sections of the Digital technologies strands highlighted <a href="http://localhost:8080/moodle/mod/book/view.php?id=1095&amp;chapterid=3724">in the earlier table</a>. But there are two content descriptions below that fall under another part of that table, illustrating that you can't clearly distinguish.</p>


<p>The following list of content descriptions related to data homogenisation is organised via the band.</p>
<ul>
